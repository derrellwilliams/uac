									Drew's been with us since 1999. After receiving a BA in Political Science from the University of Colorado in Boulder, he took a commission with the US Navy as an Intelligence officer during the first Desert Storm. Subsequent to working abroad, he spent a number of years working and guiding for NOLS and Outward Bound in Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and Alaska. Drew now spends his summers as a climbing ranger in Grand Teton National Park and went to Washington DC in 2012 to receive a Valor Award for his part in a dramatic rescue of 17 lightning strike victims near the summit of the Grand Teton. Drew is often described as a story-teller at the forecast center, infusing his forecasts with haiku, metaphor, allegory, even references to the Book of Job.  He cites Cormac McCarthy, the whale hunter Herman Melville, the dry-fly fisherman Norman Maclean, the French aviator Antoine de St. Exúpery, and Bashō as literary inspiration.  His passions include dip-netting kings out of the Copper, breaking trail, and following his son through the trees at Alta. <a href="#" class="text-link">Email Drew</a>

					<div class="text_01">(SLC Ranger District Winter Recreation Specialist Rogers Thomas and one of the original forecasters Barry Matthias  looking at a weather read-out at the NWS in the early 1980s)</div>
					<div class="text_02 pt3">
						In the winter of 1979/1980, Salt Lake Ranger District employees Pat Lambrose and Jeff Larson began recording avalanche information on a hotline to keep people on top of the Greatest Snow on Earth instead of buried beneath it.  They mention Snow Rangers Binx Sandahl and Ray Lindquist, Tom Heller and many others as great sources of snow and avalanche information at that time.  That spring of 1980, SL Ranger District Winter Sports Specialist Rogers Thomas hired Duain Bowles from Bozeman Montana and Barry Matthias of Alta, along with locals Al Soucie, Pat Lambrose, and Jeff Larson to build the Utah Avalanche Center from the ground floor.  That spring, Duain and Barry went on a remarkable road-trip to Colorado to meet with Knox Williams and Dick and Betsy Armstrong of the Colorado Avalanche Information Center and then on to Seattle to meet with Rich Marriot and Mark Moore...then on to British Columbia to meet with Jeff Freer...gleaning insights from the first two avalanche warning centers in the US to create the Utah Avalanche Forecast Center.  As with the other two avalanche centers, the UAC was sheltered at the local National Weather Service office and remain under their roof today.  Much has changed in the past 35 years, but all the forecasters share a common bond in the rich history of snow and avalanches in the Wasatch Range. Over the past couple of months, it has been particularly rewarding tracking down and connecting with retired and "on to snowier pastures" forecasters, their families and in some cases, widows to compile their stories below.  - Hardesty
